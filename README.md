#Weather-App
I’ve created a weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which fetches real-time weather data using an API. The app provides instant weather updates for your current location and lets you search for any city to check its weather conditions.
✨ Key Features:
✅ Fetches live weather data using an API ☁️
✅ Get weather updates for your location 🌍
✅ Search any city for real-time weather info 🌆
✅ Simple, responsive, and user-friendly UI 🎨
Excited to enhance it further! Let me know your thoughts.
